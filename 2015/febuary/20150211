Daily Note

2.
(keep_if & select!) VS (delete_if & reject!)
All these 4 methods will alter original array and return altered result
(Exception: when no change made, select! & reject! will return nil and no change will be done to original array)
keep_if & select! are just the opposite of delete_if & reject!
keep_if & select! keep element when result of executed block is true
delete_if & reject! remove element when result of executed block is true
Besides opposite, there's also one slight different, which is delete_if & reject! remove things every one block

4.
permutation vs combination
Both these methods generate array of arrays,
which group original array elements into array with size of given number.
The difference between 2 methods is that combination does't care about order of elements in generated array
