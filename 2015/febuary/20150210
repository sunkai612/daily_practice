Daily Note

1.
Ruby $SAFE level

In short, prohibit taint object and other dangerous input source to do things,
& freeze existing object in highest level.

What's the difference between dup & clone? And what is initialize_copy for?

Both dup and clone initialize a new instance of the class of the object on which they are invoked.
Then copy every instance variables and the taintedness of the receiver object to new allocated object.
(beware that it's the reference being copied, not the value)

clone do 2 things more than dup:
(1) copy singleton methods of the receiver object
(2) freeze copied object if original is frozen

In general, in classes which overwrite these 2 methods, clone will do all original stuff,
and dup will new an instance of the class of the object on which it is invoked

API reference:
http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Object.html#method-i-dup
http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Object.html#method-i-clone

If you want to specifically do some things after copying, you can write those doings into initialize_copy.
dup & clone will execute this method after copying (clone will do this before frozen if needed).
(& don't remember (1)to use super inside this method; (2)this is a private method)
