Daily Note

1.
What's the difference between ==, ===, equal? and eql?
In the Object class, == equals to === equals to equal?,
but normally been overwritten later in other classes

In the Object class,
==, ===, eql? using hash to check if two objs have the same content
equal? check if two objs are the same(with same object_id)

In later inherenting classes, eql? is often been overwritten,
to serve same function with ==, while it's been overwritten
(e.g. to include type conversion)

Also, in later inherenting classes, === is often been overwritten too
In Range class, === check if obj is in the range
In Regex class, use to check if match the regular expression
In Proc class, use obj as parameter to execute proc
(Up 3 usage are often used in case/when statement)

2.
Combining several commits into one commit with:
1. git merge --squash
2. git rebase --interactive

While using "git rebase --interactive", we can actually do more things as:
* pick    : choose this commit with no change
* reword  : choose this commit with changing commit message
* edit    : choose this commit with changing commit content
* squash  : combine this commit with prior commit and using this commit message
* fixup   : combine this commit with prior commit and using prior commit message
